My name is Davis, and today I'm reviewing McDonald's breakfast. A Sausage Mcgriddle, cheese Mcgriddle. Never had this before. I always get the bacon, egg and cheese bagel. So let's see how it is. Well, pretty good flavor. The thing about the sausage or about the Mcgriddle is the bun is actually like a pancake and it's like infused with syrup. That is really good. Um, feel like it's kind of bland up. Feels like it needs like, you feel like a sauces like some more flavor from something. I don't know, it's. It's not terrible. I'll probably give this like a 6 out of 10. It's not great. It's not bad though. Um, I think the bacon, egg and cheese bagel is definitely a lot better. Um, now we got the hash brown, so let's see if there's a crunch, huh? Oh god, yeah, so the hashbrown definitely has a nice crunch. I'll be like, you need some ketchup, but just regular, really good, nice crunch. I'll probably give like a 8 out of 10. That's why one of their best items at McDonald's. Um, alright, now we got a French vanilla iced coffee. If you ever watch Ryan Trehan, then you know, I'm gonna see how it is. Okay. That's pretty good. Not overpowering vanilla flavor, not too sweet. Um, it's pretty good. I'm not the like the biggest fan of coffee, but I'm definitely. I definitely enjoy it still. That's pretty good. I'll probably give that drink Like a 7 out of 10, 7.5 out of 10 overall. That's a really good drink. Let me know if there's any other breakfast spots you want me to review. Well, thank you, guys, and I'll see you tomorrow.
