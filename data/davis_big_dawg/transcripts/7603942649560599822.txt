My name is davis, and as preparation for the super bowl, we're reviewing wingstop. All right, first off, the wings here is sweet barbecue. The sweet barbecue flavor is really nice. Overall, this is a pretty good wing. It's nice and juicy in the middle. It's not like, too tough like some are. I'll probably give this wing like a eight out of ten. Alright, now for the hawaiian wing. Now, i've never had this flavor. It is pretty good though. It's nice and sweet. Um, if you can't handle spice or anything, I would definitely recommend this wing. I think I prefer the, um, barbecue more, but i'll probably give this like a six out of ten. It's actually really good. Alright, now time for the sides. First off, we got the fries. Dip it in the ranch. Now let's see how these are. Definitely not soggy either. It is pretty good, especially in the ranch. I'll probably give these fries like an eight out of ten. These are actually pretty good. They have a really nice seasoning, too. Alright, now for their corn. They do like these little corn bites with, like, cajun seasoning on them. Let's see how they are. Put a. Put it in the ranch. These are really good. Um, nice and sweet corn. I feel like they are a little bit hard to eat, a little bit messy. These are overall pretty good. Well, for the super bowl, I recommend getting the wings and The fries. See you guys tomorrow.
