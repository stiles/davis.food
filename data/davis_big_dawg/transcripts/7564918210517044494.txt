My name is Davis and this is day 20 or 21 of reviewing school food. Alright, today we got um, grilled cheese. Looks pretty good. These are pretty good. Um, I love the grilled cheese is here. Only thing they don't have the tomato soup. That makes it so much better. 8.5 out of 10. Curly fries. They're a little cold with the curly fries they like. They cool off so fast so it's hard to get them warm. Good seasoning though. Curly fries. 6 out of 10. Alright, we got carrots. Pretty good. 7 out of 10. Applesauce. I love applesauce. 9 out of ten. Alright, for today's drink, we got zero sugar lemonade. Shout out Gabe for getting me this. Love Gabe. Are you guys pretty good? It has like a weird taste though cause of the zero sugar. I'll give it 6.5 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
