My name is Davis and today we're reviewing school food. This is, um, Day 4, I think. Alright, we got a rib sandwich. The meat's pretty good. The bread is really stale though. 6.5 out of 10. Now we got a French fry. Put some ketchup on it. Let's see how it is. Pretty mediocre. French fries itself is pretty bland. Six out of 10 overall. Now we got a salad. Forgot to grab dressing, but it's alright. We'll see how it is. Pretty good. The lettuce is very nice. It has a nice crisp. Definitely enjoy that. Um, 6 out of 10 too. Now we got an apple. Has some weird marks, but we'll see how it is. I prefer Red Apples, 4 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
