My name is Davis, and this is day 17 of reviewing school food. We're in the SOR office, the sheriff's office, I guess. Resource officer office. Um, today we got popcorn chicken, Mac and cheese and uh, broccoli. Um, so here we go. I'll try it like on its own and then together. Alright. Mac and cheese super bland. Like, this was pure plastic. I feel like that cheese. Um, three out of 10. Alright, popcorn chicken, ketchup. Pretty good. It's not like too bland, but I mean, the chicken meat just. It looks funky. Um, popcorn chicken. I'll give it five out of 10. I'm trying to be like, more harsher, you know? Um, here, let's try it together though. Pretty good. Um, six out of 10. Alright, now we got broccoli. Broccoli is pretty good. Um, need some, like, salt or like pepper. Need some seasoning. Um, I actually like broccoli quite a lot, so I'll give the broccoli a 6 out of ten. Alright, now we got, um, peaches. Not as good as to uh, today. It's not that great. Um, I'll give it a 4 out of 10. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
