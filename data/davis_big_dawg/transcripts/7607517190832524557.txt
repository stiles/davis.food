My name is davis. Today i'm at mission barbecue reviewing their two meat sampler. I have their moist brisket and then their jalapeno cheese sausage and some fries. So let's start off with the brisket. The brisket is pretty good. It's nice and moist. Nice, um, flavorful. That's a pretty good brisket. Um, i'm not had too many briskets, so I don't really know, like, what's a good one. But i'll give this brisket probably like a eight out of ten. I really like it. Alright, now for the, um, jalapeno cheese sausage. Okay, not bad. It's like cheddar cheese and then like, the jalapenos add a nice little spice to it. That's pretty good sausage. I'll probably give that like a six out of ten. Not bad. All right, for the final, the fries. Okay, pretty nice brunch. They're pretty good. Um, not the best fries i've ever had, though. I would say they're pretty average. Probably like a five out of ten. Well, that's mission barbecue, guys. Thank you, and i'll see you tomorrow.
