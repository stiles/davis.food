My name is Davis and this is day 12 of reviewing school food. Alright, we got um spicy chicken sandwich. Uh today was chicken sandwich and pizza so there's nothing new. Um, sorry about that. So we'll try with a ketchup. Um mediocre again no crunch. Um it is kind of spicy today which is good. The bread could be better. No crunch on the chicken 6 out of 10. Alright, now we'll try with the ranch. I like it more with um ketchup. I'll give it I'll give it with the Ranch of 5.5. Alright, now we got um strawberry milk. Can you give me one tomorrow? Alright, I'll throw your food away. I just don't want you taste it. I prefer chocolate milk over strawberry milk. Strawberry milk is okay. Um, I'll give it like a 5 out of 10. Now we got sweet Chili Doritos. Pretty good. I feel like with the sweet chili you have to be in the mood for them compared to like the other Doritos. I'll give them a 7 out of 10. I think a good one is like Nachos, Spicy Nachos probably one of my favorite. All right, now we got a zero sugar Baja blast. Shout out Gabe for getting me this 9 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
