My name is Davis. Um, on a field trip today, so no school lunch. But we got McDonald's on the way back. Um, got chicken nuggets, French fries, and then a sweet and sour sauce. So let's try the nugget. Here you go. Okay. Nuggets good. It's nice and fresh. Crunchy. It's pretty good. I'll probably give it 7.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a French fry. Here you go. Okay. Pretty good. Um, I think I like the chick fil A fries more. I'll probably give these seven out of 10. And then sweet and sour sauce. One of my favorite sauces. I love it. I'll probably give that 9 out of 10. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
