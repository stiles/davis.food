My name is Davis. Um, no lunch review today because they keep repeating the same lunch. But, um, today we are trying Mose. Um, I have tried Chipotle. Um, now we got Mose. I got rice, adobo, chicken, sour cream, lettuce, um, tomatoes and cheese. And then do you have a little bit of queso? Here, try it with the queso. And without. Alright. Without, pretty good. Little bland. It's pretty good though. Um, I got like the value meal and get a small burrito, which is pretty big actually. Queso, chips and then a drink, um, for like 10 bucks. Really good deal. Um, let's try some queso on there. Scoop it with the chip, put it on there. Alright, here we go. Yeah, a lot better with the, um. With the queso. So without the queso, I'll probably give it 6.5 out of 10. With the queso, 7.5 out of 10. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
