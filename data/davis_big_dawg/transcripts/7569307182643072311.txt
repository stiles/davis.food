My name is Davis. Today we're at Buffalo Wild Wings. Uh, how to come back? Um, let's get into it. All right, for the first, we got the. The cheese bites, and then the. The chicken tenders. Um, they gave me caramel. They said, like, that's the signature for the cheese sauce. So let's see how it is. Alright. Okay. The grandma was actually really good. Like, I was kind of surprised. Yeah, the cheese, the grandma was really good with the, um. Like, with the breading. It's kind of like, I guess, funnel cake kind of. And then the cheese is also really good. It actually pairs really good. I'll give that eight out of ten. Alright, now we got, um, the chicken tenders, and then we have this. The same sauce as last time. It's like. I think it's like Chipotle or something. See how it is. Okay. I bit my lip. Has a nice crunch. That's definitely really good. Oops. That sauce, it. I don't know what it is, but it's pretty good. Um, nice crunch. The breadings, like, seasoned, which is good. I'll give the chicken tenders, uh, 8.5 out of 10. Alright, now for the most important part of the meal, dessert. We got the, um, the skillet cookie. So, yeah, let's see how it is. There's ice cream, chocolate chip cookie, and whipped cream on top. Come on. Pretty good. Um, the I. Something I didn't notice was the cookie wasn't cooked. All the Way through, um, but, I mean, other than that, it's still really good. Like, I mean, it's. It's cookie with ice cream. Like, obviously it's gonna be pretty good. I think the only thing that could have made this better, um, is the cookie being cooked longer. I'll give this an 8 out of 10. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
