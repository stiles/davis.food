My name is Davis. Today we're at Atlantic Mall and billiards supporting Anthony's Way, which is about teen mental health awareness. Let's go check it out. All right, first we got some lemonade, blue raspberry and mango. Um, I wish there's more blue raspberry flavor. I'll give it seven out of 10. Still really good. Alright, now we got mango. Mangoes a lot better. I'll give the mango eight out of 10. Alright, I'll see you at the next stand. Alright, now we got some uh, wings from put at the food truck real quick. Alright, here we go. Uh, garlic parmesan and lemon pepper. That is really good. For food truck. That is amazing. That's really good wings. I'll give that 8 out of 10. Alright, some lemon pepper. I'll give the garlic. I think the garlic pepper sort of better, but not by much. I'm also gonna give the weapon pepper 7 out of 10. Alright, now we got some more fries. Putting ranch on them. I like it with the other ranch more. I'll give the fries 6.5 out of 10. Alright, I'll see you guys around. Alright, now we're playing shuffleboard. Here we go. This is my first time ever playing, so let's see how I do. Alright, let's see. So one. Alright, one. Camera man. You can speak camera man if you want. I mean, please. Two, three. Two, three. No. Alright, here we go. Third shot. That's too fast. Wait, wait. Ah, alright, last. One. Here we go. Please don't be off two points. Alright, well, I'll see you guys at the next day. Now we got some ski ball. Got four rows. Let's see how I do. Wait, oh, close to the 50, actually. Alright, here we go. I'm gonna hit that 50, I know it. Oh, that's why I'm a big dog.
