My name is Davis, and this is day 24 of reviewing school food. Alright, we got a spaghetti today. The spaghetti is always pretty good. I'm always happy when we have spaghetti. I'll give it eight out of 10. Alright, now we got a breadstick. Gotta get in on the sauce. Pretty good. Nice and soft. Nice and garlicly. I mean, it's pretty good breadstick. I'll give seven out of 10. All right, now we got a salad without ranch. Okay. Pretty good salad goods. Six out of 10. Alright, today's drink is strawberry lemonade. Zero sugar. Alright. I think I like this more than the regular lemonade. Um, it's pretty good. It's not too sour, which is good. I'll give it seven out of 10, too. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
