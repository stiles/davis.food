My name is Davis, and today we're reviewing Texas Roadhouse. I just want to say thank you for 300 k. This was a meant for 100 k, but we're growing so fast, it's crazy. Um, so let's dig in. First we got a barbecue chicken. We'll see how it is. Mm, very good. A lot of barbecue sauce, which I like. A lot of good flavor. Now we got, um, a filet Mignon. Um, as for medium rare, this is like beef jerky. So we'll see how it is. Pause the video. Alright, just got done with the steak. Super overcooked, but the steak is one of my favorite foods. I still really like it. I'll give the six. I'll give the steak a 7 out of 10. Um, by the way, I review. I'm gonna review this based off other restaurants, and I review school lunch, like, based off of other school lunches. So the steak's a 7. The chicken is, um, an 8. Now we got steak fry. Super good. Got a little bit of a barbecue sauce on that. Really good. Very soggy. Because we got takeout. Um, probably a 7 out of 10, too. Now we got the Texas roll with cinnamon butter. So good. Always love these. Eight out of 10. Alright, now we got, um, a Caesar salad. Alright. Um, the lettuce is really good. It's nice and fresh. It's not, um, like, wilted or anything. Caesar salads also really like Caesar dressing. Is also really good. Not too much, but not too little. I'm giving that an 8.5 out of 10. Now we got the, um. The Texas onion. Here we go. So good. For sure, like, top 3 appetizers from, like, any restaurant. 9 out of 10. Thank you so much for her 300 K. I'll see you tomorrow.
