My name is Davis, and this is day 16 of reviewing school food. Uh, today we got a corn dog. I put a ketchup and mustard on it. The bread's like, really dry. Like, it's definitely like one of those frozen. Like, I know it's one of the frozen ones, I guess, but it's just really dry. It's not that great. Like, it definitely could have been cooked longer. I feel like that would have definitely helped it out. I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a cinnamon apples. That's depressing. Very good. So this apple pie filling, it's really good. I'll give it a 7 out of 10. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
