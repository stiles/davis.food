My name is Davis, and this is part two of reviewing, um, international snacks. I do have a little bit more for one more video if you guys want to see it, but, um, let's start off with this strawberry Oreo cake. If you've ever had a cake stir, I think this is what it is. Alright, this is what it looks like. Looks pretty cool. Oh, god, yeah. It's like a cake stir. It's pretty good. Um, nice strawberry flavor. The cake is kind of. Is really crumbly, though. It's pretty good, though. I'll give this 6.5 out of 10. It's not like my favorite thing, but it's definitely not bad. And now we got a Kitkats. Let's see if these are different from, um, the ones here. Okay, these might be dark chocolate. Pretty good. Has a slightly different taste. I don't really know how to describe it. It's pretty good, though. I'll give those 7 out of 10. Alright, now we got this Asian one. Alright, this is what it looks like. Looks pretty good. No filling inside. Okay. It's just a regular bun. It's kind of dry. It's not terrible, though. Kind of basic. I'll give this five out of 10. Well, thank you, guys. Um, let me know if you want to see another part, and I'll see you tomorrow.
