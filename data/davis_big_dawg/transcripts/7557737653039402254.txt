My name is Davis. Today we're trying the acai bowl. We got strawberries, coconut flakes, banana, Nutella drizzle, and obviously the acai. Um, I've never had one before, so let's see how it is. Go. Alright, now with the strawberry. 이거 응 it's very good. Not so you. It's kind of like a flavorless smoothie. Sort of. It's not. It doesn't have a lot of flavor, but it's really good with the banana and the strawberry. Um, I would eat it again for breakfast, but, like, it's definitely not my favorite thing. I rather have, like, eggs and, um, like bacon and toast. But, um, I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
