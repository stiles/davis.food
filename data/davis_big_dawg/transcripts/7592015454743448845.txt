It's Davis. Today I'm reviewing Los Portales supermarket. Um, I'm here with my Davy underwater. What's up, guys? First try the beef barbacoa. Oh, god. It's pretty tough, but nice seasoning. Really good flavor. I'll probably give that like a 6.5 out of 10. It's pretty nice. Give it an an 8. Good flavor to me, yes, but like you said, it is a little tough. Let's try out the rice. Okay. It's pretty good. It's kind of bland. I think it, um, needs some more flavor or something. It's not terrible, but not great. I'll probably give that a 5 out of 10. It was a. This batch is a little, like, hard. I'd give it a 6.5 here. Ever had tamales? About to try them for the first time. I think these are pork. Not terrible. First time ever trying tamales. It's pretty good. I really like the meat inside. The outer is kind of interesting. Um, 6.5 out of 10. 7 out of 10. Probably mine. Flavorful, spicy. I give that one a 9. For our drink we got. It's a Colombian soda. It's called, like, Colombiana. Okay. It tastes like bubblegum. Cheers. Cheers. Wow, that's really good. Not overpowering bubble gum flavor, but you definitely taste it a little bit. It's pretty good. It's not overly sweet, but, like, sweet enough. I'll probably give that like a 8.5 out of 10. For a soda that's really good. Yeah, I'd rate it the same. Well, to finish, It off. We're trying some, um, classic Mexican Coke. Let's see how it is. Okay. That's really good. I feel like it kind of emphasizes, like, the syrupy taste a little bit more than, like, regular American Coke. It's pretty good. It's a little bit sweeter. I'll probably give that nine out of 10. That's. That's pretty good. Well, thank you, guys, and I'll see you tomorrow. Kisses.
