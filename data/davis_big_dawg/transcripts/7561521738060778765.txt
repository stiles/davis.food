Go. My name is Davis, and today we're in the principal's office reviewing school food. This is a day 16. All right, first we got some cheese bites. Let's get some marinara. Okay. Um, I feel like they need more crisp. Um, here, the cheese ball. There's. There's not really. They're very soggy. Um, they taste fine, though. It's definitely not my favorite school lunch, but I'm not mad about it. Uh, I'll give it six out of 10. Alright, now we got, um, buttered corn. Um, feels like it needs, like, some salt, maybe some pepper. Um, five out of 10? No, four out of 10. Um, alright, now we got some sweet potatoes. They kind of look suspicious. Let's see how it is. Um, I feel like they could be cooked a little bit longer. They're pretty good, though. Sweet. Sweet potatoes also, like, isn't my, like, favorite. Give them. I'll give them a 5 out of 10. Now I got a banana. I love bananas. Um, I'll give it a 9 out of 10. Expect the principal soon. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
