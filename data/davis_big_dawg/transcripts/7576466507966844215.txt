My name is Davis, and um, today I'm trying my Friendsgiving for prayer club. Um, yeah, let's see how it is. So first we got this cookie dough dip. Um, I've never had cookie dough dip, so it seems pretty cool. Uh, with pretzel. Okay. I think it's like cream cheese base. It's pretty good. I like the salty sweet, uh, combo. Um, I'll probably give that 7 out of 10. Alright, now we got um, Pacific cooler for uh, Capri Sun. Okay. Not my favorite cause Korean sun. It's pretty good though. I think my favorite is probably like the lemonade or the cherry. Those are really good. I'll probably give this six out of 10. Alright, now we got pumpkin spice donut. Oh boy. Love pumpkin spice. Um, this is really good. I'll give this like a 8 out of 10. Alright, now we got a ham and cheese slider. Okay. Um. Oh, there's mayonnaise too. Somehow I got no cheese on my slider. Um, I'll probably give this eight out of 10. It's pretty good. Not the biggest male fan, but I don't mind if it's like just a little bit. Eight out of 10. Alright, now we got, um. Uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken. This is from I think Harris Teeter, so. Okay. No crunch. Good seasoning though. Um, I'll probably give that 7.5 out of 10. Well, that's everything. Thank you and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
