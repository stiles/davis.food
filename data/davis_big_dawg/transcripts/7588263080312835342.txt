My name is Davis. Today we're at Oklahoma Burger. Um, very excited to try this. It's quite sunny out, though, so first I'm gonna put on my shady rays. Um, let's see how this is. Very good. Okay. The thing about this place is they do a smash burger and then smash onions into it, like, while it's cooking. Very cheesy, very greasy, but very good. 葉っぱあげて nine out of 10 that's a really good burger. Alright, now we got on their fries. They actually put these in, um, barbecue seasoning. So let's see how this is. Okay. Nice seasoning. Very good. I'll probably get those. Seven out of 10. Those are actually pretty good. Nice crunch, nice and warm. Overall, really good. Come to Oklahoma Burger. I'll probably give this a 9 out of 10. Overall, really good. Well, thank you guys, and I'll see you tomorrow.
