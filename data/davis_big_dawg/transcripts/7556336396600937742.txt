My name is Davis, and this is day 7 of reviewing school lunch. Today we got a chicken sandwich. See how this. We got, uh, ketchup on there. Not bad. Um, the chicken is not crispy at all. It needs a lot more crisp. The buns, not bad today. Um, 6.5 out of 10. Now, we got our curly fries today. Super cold. Um, they definitely have a lot more, um, flavor than the potato wedges. But these are really cold. I'll give them five out of 10. All right. Um, applesauce. Uh, we do applesauce quite often. Just seven out of 10. Alright. I have a salad. Italian dressing. It's alright. Um, lettuce is not as good as last week. Um, the dressing definitely makes it taste a lot better. I'll give it six out of 10, too. All right. Um, now we got oranges. Haven't done these, so here we go. Let me get that out. Alright, here we go. Love oranges. Um, definitely juicy. Definitely really good. Seven out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
