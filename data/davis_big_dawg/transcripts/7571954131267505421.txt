My name is Davis, and this is day 27 of reviewing school food. Um, today we got orange chicken and rice. The rice, um, it's kind of hard. Um, it's okay. The chicken is really good, though. Overall, seven and a half out of 10. I really like this meal. Alright, now we got some, uh, cucumbers. Okay. Pretty good. Um, I mean, it's just cucumbers and ranch. I'll give it a 6 out of 10. Um, no drink today. Kind of a short lunch review, but, um, yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
