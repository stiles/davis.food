My name is Davis, and today we're trying the new SpongeBob meal. Um, they did not have the strawberry pie and the pineapple, um, drink. So we got frozen Coca Cola and then the Hershey pie. But first, let's try out the burger. Oh, well, the bun is yellow. It's really, um. It's really thick. Very big bun. Um, kind of overpowers your burger. Is actually really good. Um, there's tomatoes, onions, pickles, ketchup, Mayo, lettuce. It's. It's pretty good. I'll probably give that six out of 10. Only because of how thick the bun is. Alright, now we got out of the new bacon cheese tots. Okay, pretty good. I definitely get the bacon taste, but I see no bacon. Um, they taste pretty good though. Nice and cheesy. I'll give those seven out of 10. They're pretty good. Alright, now we got a. The Hershey pie. This is what it looks like. It looks very good. Alright, here we go. Okay. Nice and chocolatey, nice and creamy. That's actually really good. I'll probably give it that nine out of 10. I really enjoy that. Alright, now we got, uh, the frozen Coca Cola. Okay. Just tastes like. Just like you would imagine. It's pretty good, though. Okay, with that. Seven out of 10. Well, thank you guys. Sorry, uh, I didn't review the pineapple drink or the strawberry pie. I wish I could, but, um. Yeah, thank you guys, and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
