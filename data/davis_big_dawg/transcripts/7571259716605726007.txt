Hi, my name is Davis, and this is day 26 of reviewing school food. Um, it's another repeat day, so. Sorry. Got a cheese bites for a marinara. Not that great. Um, they're just really. Just bad. They're really, like, wet. 4.5 out of 10. Right now we got, um, tater tot, a little bit ketchup. Very, very mediocre. Cooked it. Cook longer. Five out of 10. Corn. How's the porky taste? Not that great. Five out of 10. Right now we got, um. Seven out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
