My name is Davis, and this is day 25 of reviewing school food. Um, sorry I haven't really been posting. I've been sick. And also, um, there's pretty a CTS this week, but, um, here we go. First we got a original Doritos. Okay. Pretty good. I mean, I feel like everyone tried a Dorito. I'll give it a 7 out of ten. Right now we got the Turkey and cheese sub. I put lettuce, tomato, mustard, and I'm gonna put some Doritos on there. We'll. We'll do that. Alright. Alright, here we go. Hello. Um, the cheese is fake American cheese, so it's not that great. The Turkey is really good. The mustard is good. Um, just regular Heinz mustard. Um, yeah, overall it's pretty good. Um, I'll give it 6.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got, um, zero sugar Sprite. How dare you disobey? Alright, pretty good. Deer sugar fries. Like, can't really taste that as diet. I'll give it 8.5 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
