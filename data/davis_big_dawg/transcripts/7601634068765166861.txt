My name is Davis. Today I'm at Buffalo Wild Wings doing their hottest wing. It is called the Blazing Knockout. It is 350,000 Scoville units. So, uh, let's give it a try. Oh, god. Starting off not too, um, spicy. I'm trying to feel it now a little bit more in the mouth. It's really, um, smoky. Um, they don't really smell spicy. They kind of smell, like, sweet. Oh, I can really feel it now in the mouth. It's a really big mouth feel. Um, they said this. It has the nine hottest peppers in the world in it. I'm trying to hold off from the milk, but. Oh, I can feel it. Oh, I know. It's kind of reaching the throat. Um, I'm tearing up. Okay. Also, make sure you go look at my cameo. It's in my bio. I need milk. Okay. I was expecting a lot worse. It's not. It's not good, though. I'll give this, like, a three out of 10. I don't enjoy this. Well, that's the blazing wings, guys. Thank you, and I'll see you tomorrow.
