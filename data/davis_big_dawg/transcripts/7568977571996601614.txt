My name is Davis. Um, today we're reviews, uh, my home food, bring it to school, pack my lunch today. Since it was Cheesy Bites. Um, I've already done that twice. So first we got a chicken quesadilla. Okay. Pretty good. Um, I wish it was still warm. It's kind of hard to do that, though. I mean, I'll give it seven out of 10. It's pretty good. And now we got, um, the Harvest Cheddar. Um, Sun Chips. Mm. Go. Really good. I'll give it an eight out of 10. Oh, now we got honey Stinger energy waffle. Pretty good. Cookie and cream flavor. Um, it's alright. I'll give it five out of 10. Alright, for today's drink, we got diet green tea, citrus, uh, lemon. Gabe got me this. Alright. There, there, there's a bee. I got it. Um, it's kind of. Kind of, um. What's the word I'm looking for? It's like, um. It's, um. It's not sweet, though. I'll give this six out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
