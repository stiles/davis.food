My name is Davis, and today we're reviewing Dave's Hot Chicken. First we're gonna review, like, the meal and then the extra hot tender, which is, um, 200,000 Scoville units. The Wingstop one was for sure not. It was probably like 100,000. So stay tuned for that. Um, first we got a. The slider and then we also got. No, hold up. This big thing is sauce. Alright, we're gonna try with, with and without the sauce. I really like this hot. Um, 8 out of 10. I got a medium. Nine out of 10. Fries. Pretty good. Um, they're not the best fries ever. Hmm. Seven out of 10. Alright, stop. Alright, um, here's the tender. Uh, I peeled off a piece for the cameraman. Um, but here we go. Here. I'm. I'm not gonna see sauce. And I got some milk. We'll see how long I can last without it. Um, is. This one is more mouthy than Wingstop. Uh, I wanna also wanna thank for 600 k. Um, crazy. This is bad. I was gonna do the reaper, but it's 1.5 million. I'm not doing all that. Æ well, thank you. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
