My name is davis, and today i'm reviewing bronco bagels. My mom got this from walmart. Um, as someone that has school pretty early, I like to have something quick and easy for breakfast, and with this, you can just either pop it in the microwave or in the air fryer. Um, and then it's done. Yeah. Oh, well, this one is turkey, sausage, egg, and cheese. That is really good. I like how the bagel gets a little crispy in the outside, and, like, it's pretty, uh, soft in the middle. Um, sausage is good, cheese is good. This is overall a really good, um, like, breakfast frozen sandwich. I've had a good amount of them, so, um, this one's definitely high up there. You can get this from target, I believe, and this is really good. Thank you, guys, and i'll see you tomorrow.
