My name is Davis, and I think this is day 11 of reviewing school food. Today we got, um, corn dog. I have ketchup with it. Um, I wish the brightening had crisp. Um, it's not that great. It's not like the worst school lunch, but it's definitely not the best. Five out of ten. Alright, now we got a salad. I, uh, I mixed Italian dressing and a little bit of ranch. Um, I like the combination. I made. Um, how much? I just did ranch. 6 out of 10. I know you guys have been asking for a drink, so, um, they have milk. I don't usually grab milk, but, um, I'll review it for you guys. Here we go. Pretty good, but it's just chocolate milk. Eight out of ten. Now today they got this, like, blue raspberry squeeze thing. Um, it's okay. Like six out of 10. Um, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
