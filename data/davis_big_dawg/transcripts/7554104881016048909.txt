My name is Davis. This is day 3 of reviewing school food. Today we got a spaghetti that's actually very good. I'll give that an 8 out of ten. Alright, now we got, um, melon. Oh, it's really good. Eight out of 10. And then breadstick. Pretty, pretty decent. Seven out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
