My name is Davis. This is day 2 of reviewing school lunch. Today we got some type of sausage pizza, badass. I give it like 7 out of 10. We got rice, super bland. 4 out of 10. Pineapple. It's pretty good. Alright, I give this, wait, do you have the video? Uh, 7 out of 10 too. And then apple, cause you guys keep saying to eat it. Ew, that's nasty. 0 out of 10, bro. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
