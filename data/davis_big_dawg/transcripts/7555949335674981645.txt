My name is Davis, and this is day 6 of reviewing school food. Today we got a walking taco. Get a close up. Dude, this looks so good. Actually, I'm kind of excited. Oh, here we go. That's actually really good. That's a nine out of 10. That is really good. Actually, maybe 10 out of 10. I, I don't really know. We got the rice. It's alright. Still really bland. Six out of 10. Like, it has more flavor than last time, but six out of 10. Now we got a cucumber salad. Really good. I love cucumber. 8 out of 10. Alright, now we got a applesauce. Just plain old applesauce. Yo, Davis, can I get an autograph? After. After. Um, 7 out of 10. Pretty good. Now we got on peaches. You're the GOAT, babe. 7 out of 10. Um, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you for 100 K. Something big is in the works for tomorrow.
