My name is Davis, and this is day 8 of reviewing school food. Today we got a spicy chicken sandwich. Um, pretty good. No crunch. That's a little bit of cake, but not a lot. Um, 6 out of 10. I need to be harsher on my review, so I'm gonna start trying to be a little bit more harsher. 6 out of 10. Now we got a French fry. Six out of 10, too. Now we got a fish finger. I have a little bit of tartar sauce. Not terrible. Um, it's not really much crunch. I'm gonna try with ketchup. I like ketchup a little bit more. Um, 6 out of 10 with the ketchup. 4.5 out of 10 with the tartar sauce. Now we got a salad with the ranch today. Pretty good. Lettuce is good today. Um, six out of 10, too. I'll go, uh, orange. Um, a lot of seeds. Pretty good. Um, it's not the best. Five out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
