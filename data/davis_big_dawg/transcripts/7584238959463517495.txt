My name is Davis, and today we're reviewing Zaxby's. Um, let's see how it is. Okay. Fries are pretty good. I really like the seasoning they put on them. Um, they aren't crunchy though. The. Their fries are always soft. Overall, they're pretty good though. Um, I'll give those 8 out of 10. By the way, I'm dipping them in Zax sauce. Alright, now we got, um, tenders. See how they are. They look pretty good. The meat, it's nice and good. It's definitely not fake, which I like. They don't over batter these either, which is pretty good. The chicken tender, it's not too crunchy. It's pretty good though. I'll probably give these 6.57 out of 10. For a chicken tender, they're pretty nice. All right, now we got their Texas toast. Really good. Nice and buttery. Um, overall, really good. I'll probably give that eight out of 10. Yeah, and then the sauce, I'll probably give that seven out of 10. It's pretty good. I don't really know how to, uh, explain it. It's pretty good though. Well, thank you guys. That was Jack's bees. Overall, pretty good. Probably give that 7 out of 10. Overall, I live on the East Coast, so I don't have raising canes, but I do enjoy Jack's bees quite a lot. Um, thank you guys, and I'll see you tomorrow.
