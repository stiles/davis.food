My name is Davis. This is day 10 of reviewing school food. We got a meatball sub today that's really good. Um, the meatballs are really good, the bread is good, and cheese is good. Eight out of 10. Alright, now we got a cucumber salad. Here's more of the dressing. I'll give it five out of 10. Now we got a banana. It's just a basic banana. Eight out of 10. Alright, now we got, um, ruffles. Baked. The cheese kind. Pretty good. Um, I really like the baked chip. Um, 9 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
