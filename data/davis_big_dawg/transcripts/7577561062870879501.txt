It's Davis. And today we're reviewing my, uh, Thanksgiving dinner. My sister made all this, so see how it is. So first we're gonna do the Turkey. Okay. Very juicy. It's not dry at all, which very surprising. Turkey is very hard to make. I feel like nine out of 10. That's really good Turkey. Alright, now we got our mashed potatoes. Oh, they're okay. I'll give those seven out of 10. Alright, now we got the Mac and cheese. Okay. It's pretty good. It's, um, it's not watery or anything. It's like, it's really, uh, I guess thick. It's good. Um, it's nice and rich, too. I'll give that 8.5 out of 10 for Mac and cheese. Alright, now we got a green beans. She cooked these in, like, butter and stuff and, like, garlic. Those are pretty good. I'll give those eight out of 10. Like, the garlic and the butter definitely adds a lot. Yeah. Eight out of 10. Alright, now we got a stuffing. Stuffing's not my favorite, so we'll see how this is. This stuffing is really moist. It's, like, really, uh, wet. It's okay. It's not my, like, it's not the best stuffing I've ever had. I'll probably give that six out of 10. Well, that was my Thanksgiving dinner. I would just wanna say thank you for all the people that watch my videos, like my videos, and all my followers, and, um, I hope you guys had a good Thanksgiving, and I'll See you guys tomorrow.
