My name is Davis. Uh, we're at the first playoff game for varsity. Um, let's. Let's review the concession stand food. Uh, we got a Zaxby's chicken sandwich. Okay. Um, I can definitely tell it's been sitting in there, um, but it's hard to like, keep it, uh, fresh cause they pre order it. Um, I'll give it a six out of 10. Alright, now we got some, um, popcorn. I love you, Davis. Alright, um, popcorn. It's not warm. It's nice and buttery and salty though. I'll give it five out of 10 for popcorn. All right, now we got, um, cool blue Gatorade, 58. Dak Smith Khamisi. Okay, pretty good. It's not my favorite flavor of Gatorade, but it's definitely like probably top five. Nine out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
