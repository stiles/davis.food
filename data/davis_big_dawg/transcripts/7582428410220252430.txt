My name is Davis, and this is day 33 of reviewing school food. Today we got tomato soup and a spicy chicken sandwich. This is what it's looking like. Alright, here we go. I'm gonna dip the chicken sandwich in the tomato soup. Alright? Very good. The chicken sandwich and tomato soup combo is really good. Um, so the chicken sandwich needs more of a crunch. Um, it's nice and spicy, though. Needs more of a crunch, though. I'll give that 6.5 out of 10. Now we're gonna review the tomato soup by itself. Okay? Nice and sweet. It's not really hot. Really hot, but it's good, though. Um, I'll probably give that 8 out of ten. Right now we got peaches. Hold on. They're, like, really mushy. Today, I'll probably give these six out of 10. Not that great. Well, thank you guys, and I'll see you tomorrow.
