My name is Davis. Um, we have no school today since it's Veterans Day. It's also my birthday, which is pretty cool. Um, but for today's video, we're trying international Snacks. I have some laid out here. Um, yeah, so first we got. I got this Cherry, like, Coke product. I'm gonna pour it into a glass. Um, all these snacks are from Bussin Snacks, so. Thank you. I got like the 30 for 30 box, but, um, here you go. Okay. It's pretty good. It's um. It reminds me of like Dr. Pepper, kind of. I like it. I'll probably give this eight out of ten. All right, now we got, um, chicken wing Cheetos. Yeah. One is. Hold on. Kind of sweet, but I don't get like too much of a chicken flavor. It's okay. I'll probably give this probably like a five out of 10. Alright, now we got, um, a peach, like white peach filled, like chocolate stuff. Like it maybe like a chocolate wafer. Okay, so this is what it looks like. It's like. Looks like a chocolate, like wafer. Let's see the inside. Oh, god. It's like white in this inside. It's not what I would expect. It's pretty good though. I feel like it doesn't match up too good. I'll probably give that six out of 10. Um, we'll try one more before I get off. We got these Oreos. All right. They're out of yellow. OK. Not too sure what it is. Maybe, like, coffee? I don't know. It's pretty good, though. I'll probably give these, like, a six out of 10, too. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
