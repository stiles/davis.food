My name is Davis, and today I'm at Zocalo trying to Aztec quesadilla. There's steak, cheese, onions, and then some type of like, sauce on top. Let's see how it is. Oh, wow. It's really good. It's nice and cheesy. Um, the steak is really tender and nice and seasoned. That's actually a really good quesadilla. I'll probably give that like an 8.75 out of 10. That is really good. Alright, now we got another rice. Okay. Pretty good. It is a little bland, but it is pretty good. I'll probably give that like a 6 out of 10. Um, it's very comparable to the, um, El Cielo I did. Not bad though. Alright, now for the black beans. Um, these look. It's like black refried beans. This looks pretty good. Let's see how it is. Oh, god. Definitely not the biggest bean, uh, biggest fan of beans. It is pretty good though. I'll probably give those beans like a 7 out of 10. It's a Cola. Thank you guys, and I'll see you tomorrow.
