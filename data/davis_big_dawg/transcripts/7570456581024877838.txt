My name is Davis. Today we got, um, the ball hall blast pie. I've seen some stuff about this. Kind of excited. Um, let's just get into it. OG. Da. Um. Alright, so I got a little bit of ball blast here. I got the ball blast to like, compare. Okay, yeah. So the pie is like, sort of like the ball of last. Um, it's. The filling is really, like, sticky and the cream is really sweet. Um, I'll probably give this like, like a 7 out of 10. It's pretty good. It's like, kind of hard to explain, though. Um, apparently there's only like 12 in each location, so I'm very happy I got one to review for you guys. I'll probably give this, yeah, like 7 out of 10. Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
