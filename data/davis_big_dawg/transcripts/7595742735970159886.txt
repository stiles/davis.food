My name is Davis, and today we're trying Cava. Very excited to try this. This is um, similar to Chipotle, but it's um, Greek. More Greek. Um, looks really good, but before I try this, make sure to go check out my Canyon. It's connected to my linktree, which is in my bio. Um, in my bowl I got brown rice, chicken, harissa, tzatziki, fire roasted corn, tomato, cucumber, tomato, onion, fiery broccoli, shredded romaine, pita crisps, and the garlic dressing. This looks really good. Um, I'm very excited to try this. I already went ahead and mixed it up, so let's see how it is. Okay. That is actually really good. Um, definitely surprised me there. I feel like the pita chips. Um, pita chips add a nice crunch. Um, the harissa definitely adds a kick. It is pretty spicy. Um, but if you like spicy, definitely recommend that. It's nice and garlicky from the garlic dressing. This is overall a really good bowl. Um, I'll probably give this like a 8.5 out of 10. I think it definitely compares to like Chipotle. Alright, now for the drink. We got blueberry, lavender, um, drink. Um, let's see how it is. Oh, well, nice and blueberry, nice and lavender. Um, it's not too overpowering. It's not too sweet either. Um, there's just a touch of lavender and touch of blueberry. That is really good. Nice and refreshing. Yeah, overall I'll probably give that drink like a 7 out of 10. I really enjoy that. Well, make sure you guys go check out my cameo in my bio, and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
