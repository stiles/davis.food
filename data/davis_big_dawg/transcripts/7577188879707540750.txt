My name is Davis, and today we're cooking. We're making chicken tenders. So if you come over here, um, chicken tenders, uh, corn flakes, flour, egg, and then I have some seasonings. So let's first season the chicken. First we got garlic powder. I'm not a cook or anything, so we'll see how I do. Alright, now we got onion powder. There we go. Gonna be a big mess, but who cares? Alright, now we got pepper and we got salt. Gotta make sure it's nice and seasoned. So I'll do the same on these side. Now we're gonna dip these. Alright, now we're gonna coat these in flour, egg, then the corn flakes. So first flour, get it nice and floury. Alright, now we got the egg. Wanna make sure it's nice and eggy. So we can uh, pick up the Corn Flakes. Corn Flakes and put some on top. Now I'm gonna just repeat this process. Alright, now we're gonna coat these in some oil spray. Here we go. Alright, that's all you really need. Now we're gonna put these air fryer at 400 for 15 minutes. So here we go. Alright, here they are. Um, very excited to try these, so let's. Let's just go ahead and see how the crunch is too. What? Pretty good. Um, the chicken's a little dry, um, and I could use more seasoning. I feel like overall it's pretty decent. Um, I'll give that 6.5 out of 10. Alright, now we Got honey mustard. This honey mustard is really good, and so definitely improves the chicken with the sauce. Eight out of 10. Well, thank you, guys. I hope you guys enjoyed me cooking. Um, I don't usually cook, so. Yeah, thank you, guys, and I'll see you tomorrow.
