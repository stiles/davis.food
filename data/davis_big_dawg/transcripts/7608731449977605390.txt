My name is davis. Today i'm at hammock brewery in myrtle beach, south carolina. I got the grill master plate. It comes with like, chimichurri steak, barbecue ribs, uh, chicken, like, honey roasted cornbread, and mac and cheese. So let's try the steak first. Overall, that steak is pretty good. I feel like it is really chewy, but it's cooked pretty good. Nice medium rare. And like, the chimichurri on top is pretty good. Now the barbecue ribs. Alright, here we go. All right. Those ribs are really fatty. They are really good though. Nice barbecue glaze on top. Um, I feel like it's nice and sweet. Overall, really good ribs. I'll give those ribs like a nine out of ten. And then the chimichurri, um, steak, probably like a seven out of ten. Alright, now the chicken. That chicken is cooked really good. Um, I really like the seasoning they put on it. I'm not really too sure what it is, but it is really nice. Overall, that chicken probably like an eight point five out of ten. That is really good. Alright, now time for the mac and cheese. This mac and cheese is pretty good. Um, you can definitely tell it's like homemade. Really nice cheese sauce. Um, I like the noodles they use. I'll probably give this mac and cheese like, um, eight out of ten. Alright, now time for the garlic roasted cornbread. I put some butter on there too. That is pretty good. I've Never really had anything like this. It's nice and sweet. Um, it is pretty crumbly, but it's really good cornbread. I'll give that cornbread, like, a eight out of ten. And i'll also give the mac and cheese, like, a nine out of ten. Overall, definitely recommend. This place is very good. Um, and yeah, thank you. And i'll see you tomorrow.
