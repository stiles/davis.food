My name is Davis. Today we're at local tavern. Um, today we're trying Philly cheesesteaks, onion rings, fries, and we got some wings. But I. Yeah, let's get into this. Our first, the Philly cheesesteak. I love ranch on my Philly cheesesteaks. I don't know, I've always done it. So make it Jared Wilson, left guard. He's one of those rookies on the left side is my favorite. Checked out his rookie guard. And we'll pretty good. The meat's nice, the onions are good. Nice and cheesy. Kind of greasy though. It's not terrible. That's kind of greasy. I'll probably give that seven out of 10. It's not the best blue cheese I've had, but it's pretty good. Or now we got a like onion, onion ring, shoe fries type thing. Okay, pretty good. Um, could be warmer. Has a nice flavor though. Um, I'll probably give those 7 out of 10. Um, now we got a fries. I'm gonna use the ranch. Oh, god. Yeah, these are really good. They have a nice crunch. Um, they're close good too. I'll give these nine out of 10. Now we got some wings. First we'll try the barbecue. It's nice and big. Let's see how this is. That's pretty good. It's nice, sweet barbecue. Uh, the wings is nice and juicy. Um, I think I could use a little bit more sauce. Overall it's pretty good though. I'll probably give that 8 out of 10. Alright, now we got a lemon Pepper. Oh, well, nice and hot. Nice and juicy. The lemon duffle. You can definitely taste the lemon. Um, that's pretty good. I'll give those 7.75 out of 10. That's. That's pretty good. Well, thank you. I'll definitely come out. Try Local Tavern in Leland, North Carolina. And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
