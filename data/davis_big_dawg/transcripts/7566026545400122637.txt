My name is Davis, and this is day 22 of reviewing school food. All right, uh, we got a meatball sub today. Pretty good, I'll give it. Um, it needs more meatballs, um, and probably more meat sauce. 6.5 out of 10. Now we gotta fry. I'll try it with ketchup and without ranch. The ranch is kinda weird today. It's like, really sour. With the ranch, 3 out of 10. With the ketchup, 4 out of 10. Yeah. Alright, now we got, um, carrot. Enjoy your carrot. I mean, six out of 10. Right now we got zero Sugar Mountain Dew. Pretty good. I'll give it 8 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
