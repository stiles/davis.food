My name is Davis, and today we're reviewing Mcallister's deli. Um, also want to just say, make sure you guys go follow my Instagram. I'll put a photo up here. It's Davis dot 0, underscore 0. Um, any other Instagram is fake, but, um, here we go. We'll review this today. I got the chicken Caesar wrap, so let's see how it is. Okay. It's pretty good. Um, lettuce is nice and fresh. Chicken is nice and good. Um, nice. Like, a good amount of cheese, not too much. Um, Caesar dressing. I'll give that eight out of 10. Pretty good. Um, now we got a potato with cheese and bacon. So here, let me get a little bit of bacon on here. Oh, well, nice and good. It was definitely really hot, and we brought this home, which is really good. Nice and cheesy. That's pretty good. I'll probably give that seven out of 10. They also put butter on there. Very good. Um, Mccallister's, they do soups, sandwiches, and potatoes. Loaded potatoes. Overall, pretty good. Um, and yeah, I think overall, probably like an 8 out of 10. And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
