My name is Davis, and today we're reviewing my local Chinese spot. Um, let's see how it is. First we got, I think, chicken fried rice. Okay. It's pretty good. It's a little dry, but it has good flavor. When I get Chinese food, I always get a. The fried rice. I'll probably give that 7.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got our white rice. Okay, that's really good. That's really good, too. It's not as good as, uh, the fried rice, though. I'll probably give that six out of 10. Alright, now we got a pork. Okay. I really like the sauces in. I'll give that 6.5 out of 10. It's kind of tough, but it's pretty good, though. Um. Alright, now we got baby corn. I love baby corn. The baby corn is really good. I'll probably give that six out. Not six out of 10. Seven out of 10. Yeah. Alright, now we got all the broccoli. Oh, god. Mm hmm. The broccoli is really good. Yeah. I really like how it soaks up, like, the. Like, the juices. Really good. I'll give that a 8 out of 10. Well, thank you, and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
