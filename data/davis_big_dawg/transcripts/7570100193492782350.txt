My name is Davis. This is day 26 of reviewing school food. Um, today we got the. The rib sandwich with some barbecue sauce. Um, the bread is pretty good. It's very dry, though. The barbecue sauce definitely, like, kind of carries it. Overall, it's. It's pretty good, though. Like, with the barbecue sauce. I'll give it a 7 out of 10. Alright, now we got, um, Taylor Farm grapes. Alright, let's see. Oh, well, they're, um. They're mushy, not crunchy. Um, which is kind of unfortunate. They're still pretty good, though. Like, they're definitely not the best grapes, though. I'll give it five out of 10. Alright, now we got a zero sugar story. Okay. Pretty good. It's pretty similar to the zero sugar, um, Sprite. I'll give it eight out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
