The caramel on top, the ice cream on top, that is amazing. Just melts in your mouth. Yeah. All right, now we got some, uh, Tres leche cake. Uh, this is my first time ever trying it, so see how it is compare to other Tres leches cakes. Where would you say this is okay? Compared to other Tres leches cakes, this one's a little bit harder. I would say this is uh. I think it's just too sweet for my. Probably for like a just. Let's just cake. Oh, well, I give this a seven out of 10. All right. Um, it's my first time ever having a just.
