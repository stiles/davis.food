My name is Davis, and this is day 20 of reviewing school food. Alright, today we got, um, chicken Alfredo. Hmm. Pretty good. Um, the chicken has really nice seasoning, which I'm very surprised about. And the cheese sauce is also really good. I'll give it 8.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a breadstick. Pretty good. Nice and garlicky. I'll give it seven out of 10. Alright, let's put the Alfredo on top of the breadstick. Eight out of 10. I guess it kind of, like, matched the flavor of the cheese and stuff. Eight out of 10. And now we got carrots with some ranch. Pretty good. Um, 7 out of 10. Cherry, uh, Cherry Pepsi. Pretty good. Um, it's definitely not like my favorite zero sugar soda. There's also some more zero sugar sodas, um, up there, and you have to pay extra, but it's fine. Um, I'll make sure to start reviewing those, too. Um, zero sugar, uh, Cherry Pepsi. 7.5 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
