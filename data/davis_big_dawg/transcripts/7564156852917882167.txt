My name is Davis, and this is day 19 of reviewing small food. Uh, right now we got a chicken sandwich. I'll put some ketchup on there. Pretty good. Um, I had to redo the TikTok, so I already took a bite. The first bite was really spicy. This one's not spicy at all, which shows that it's, like, inconsistent with the spice level. I'll give it a four out of 10. Alright, now we got some, uh, corn. What? Man, I feel like they need to, like, put salt and pepper packets up there. Like, that corn has no seasoning. Um, 5 out of 10. Now we got the tater tots. I'm not seeing these in a while. Ever since our, uh, incident with, like, episode 3 or 2. Alright, here we go. There's a wall. Where is it? Very much again. Um, four out of 10. Right now we got a salad. I'll put ranch on there. The lettuce is not that. Um, the lettuce is not that. The lettuce is, like, wilted. It's not that great. Um, I'll give today's salad a four out of ten. Alright, now we got zero sugar, blackberry, Dr. Pepper. Okay, that's really good. I love Dr. Pepper. I'll give the Blackberry eight out of ten. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
