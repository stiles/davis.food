My name is Davis, and today I'm trying the Ultimate Sampler at Buffalo Wild Wings. Sliders. Oh, well, there's some ketchup on there. Nice and Cheesy. Patty's not overcooked. That's a very, very solid slider. That's pretty good. I'll probably give that a slider. A seven and a half. That's a very good slider. Now we got the mozzarella sticks. I'm gonna dip them. Dip them in our ranch. Pretty good cheese pull. I think they could be cooked a little bit more. They're pretty good cheese stick. I'll probably give them like a 6 out of 10. And now for their onion rings. To put these in the beer cheese. Those onion rings, a nice crunch. Could be crunchier. I've had better onion rings. Not the best. They are pretty good dipped in the beer cheese. The beer cheese is very good. These onion rings, I'll probably give like a 5 out of 10. It's definitely, uh, very mediocre. Not terrible though. I know for the boneless wing, I got honey barbecue. I'm gonna dip them in ranch. Those wings are pretty good. Um, could have a little bit more sauce. Um, pretty good crunch. I think I definitely rather have the bone and wings. Boneless wings, they probably like a six and a half out of ten. Definitely pretty good overall. This was 17 bucks. You get four choices and four, um, sides. So definitely pretty good. Um, good deal, but that's Buffalo Wild Wings, and I'll see You guys tomorrow
