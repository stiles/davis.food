My name is Davis, and today we're, uh, we're trying atomic, uh, tenders from Wingstop. This is the highest. It's 200,000 Scoville units. I'll do it with my friend, uh, indie here. It's gonna be spicy. Alright, bro. Here we go, bro. Cheers. Cheers. Enggak. At the beginning, you don't really taste it. I'm very bad at spice. I can barely taste it right now. Um, I just want to say thank you for so all the followers. Um, soon to hit 4 400,000. I suck with spice. Oh my god. Alright, uh, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
