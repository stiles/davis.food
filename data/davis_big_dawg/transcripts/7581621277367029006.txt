My name is Davis, and today we're reviewing the new Grinch meal. Um, they did not have any socks, so unfortunately, I can't really unbox those. But I do have the Grinch fries, and then I got the Big Mac. So let's try the Big Mac first. Um, this comes with lettuce. They're like Mac sauce, onions, two patties and cheese. See how it is. Hold on. Pretty good. I really enjoyed the Big Mac sauce. It's like a thousand Islands. Um, I feel like the three buns is a little too much. It's pretty good, though. I'll give that seven out of 10. Alright, here are the Grinch fries. It comes with this dill pickle, um, seasoning. So let's see how it is. Here they are. Okay, not bad. Um, nice pickly flavor. If you've ever had the Pickle Lay's chips, it reminds me of that seasoning. It's not terrible. I think I prefer regular fries more. I'll give that six out of ten. Alright, now we got a diet Dr. Pepper. Oh, it's good. It's one of my favorite, uh, diet sodas. I'll give that eight out of 10. Well, thank you guys, and I'll see you tomorrow.
