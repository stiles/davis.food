My name is Davis. Today we're at the Hispanic Heritage Expo. There we go. Alright, first thing we got today is a quesadilla. I have a little bit of lettuce on there. Pretty good. Um, kind of bland. I'll give it five out of 10. Now we got, um, I'm not really too sure what this is. Um, it's like a crispy tortilla with chicken inside. Um, it's a corn tortilla. I'm not a corn tortilla guy. Um, a little dry, but the meat is really good. Six out of 10. I'll see you at the next stand. All right, now we got, um, some chamoy and Tajin. Uh, peaches. Sticky. Pretty good. I'll give it an 8 out of 10. I like your boy stuff. So 8 out of 10. I'll see you at the next food. All right, now we got, um, some apples with your boy. Some like, Mexican candy and stuff. Uh, I think it's watermelon or something. I gotta get it out. Very good. I think I like it more than the beach drinks. I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10. Like, no, 8.5. I'll see you at the next food. All right, now we got some horchata. Wow. First time ever trying it. Um, probably like 6.5 out of 10. Sorry guys, we couldn't go to any more booths though. I'll see you guys at lunch.
