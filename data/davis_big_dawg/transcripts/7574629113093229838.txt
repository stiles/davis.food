My name is Davis. Um, today we're reviewing chick fil A. No lunch review cause they keep repeating the same foods, but um, hopefully they'll change it up soon. All right, uh, we got the chicken sandwich. Put some chick fil a sauce on there. Var. God. Pretty good. I really like the bun. Um, it's nice and soft. Chicken's pretty good. Overall, I'll give that 8.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a French fry. Okay. Pretty good. Um, only place to get waffle fries from. Always Really Good. I'll probably give those 8 out of 10. And, um, the chick fil a sauce, it's more like a honey mustard based if you've never had it. Also really good. Chick fil a sauce. Probably like a 9.5 out of 10. Always love that. Well, thank you guys. I'll see you tomorrow.
