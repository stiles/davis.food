My name is Davis, and today we're reviewing cookout. I got the cheddar style burger, uh, chicken quesadilla, and then Cajun fries. My name is Clay, and I got the regular cheeseburger, the regular fries, and chicken nuggets. Alright, so let's try out the burgers first. Pretty good. Um, it's good flavor. I wish I could taste like, the bacon more. Needs more of a bacony taste. A lot of cheese on it, which I mean, is always good, and grilled onions. It's pretty basic burger. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor, though. Well, bland. I'll give mine a 6.5 out of 10. Mine. Mine was really good. It's plain, just cheese and lettuce on it, but it has a lot of salt, but I love salt, so I'll give mine an 8 out of 10. Alright, now we got, um, the fries. I got Cajun, he got regular. They definitely hooked me up with the Cajun seasoning, which I like. Very good. Um, it's not really crunchy, though. They're. They're. I mean, I feel like cookout always has like, soggy fries, though. They're still really good. I'll give it seven out of 10. Yeah, I agree. They're a little bit soggy. Nothing wrong with them. Six out of 10. Alright, and then I got the chicken quesadilla, he got, um, chicken nuggets. So Chicken Casey is really good. Like, for this being like, a burger spot kind of. Chicken Casey is really good. I'll give It eight out of 10. It has good seasoning. And I'd say the chicken nuggets, normally maybe a four out of 10. Three out of 10. They actually did the chicken nuggets really well this time. I'll give it a six out of 10. It's pretty good. Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
