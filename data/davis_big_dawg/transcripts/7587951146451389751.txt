My name is Davis. My mom made Christmas dinner and let's try it out. She made lasagna. Okay. Pretty good. Unfortunately, there's no meat in there. It's pretty good though. Nice and cheesy. Nice and saucy. Um, could maybe use some more noodle. Overall, pretty good. Alright, now we got, um, Texas toast. And dip it in there. Love Texas toast. It's super good. Really nice. Soft in the middle, crunchy on the outside. Nice and garlicky. Overall, probably give this an 8 out of 10. The lasagna, probably 7 out of 10. Um, pretty good. Merry Christmas, everyone. Hope everyone, uh, got what they wanted. Spend time with family and enjoy their Christmas dinner. Thank you guys. And I'll see you tomorrow.
