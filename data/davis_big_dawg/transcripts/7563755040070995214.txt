My name is Davis, and this is day 18 of reviewing school food. Today I got the cold lunch. So first, let's start with this salad. I'll give it 6 out of 10. Alright, now we gotta grape jelly. Uh, uncrossable. Um, I feel like everyone's had it on trustable. I mean, it's pretty good, but it's just a BB and J. 6 out of 10. Or now we got, um, watermelon flavored. Uh, crazy. It's very good. Um, I definitely like these. Every time I get school lunch, I love these. 7 out of ten. There's a whole grain. Okay. Um, since there's a whole grain, they're not as good. Five out of 10. Now we got a barbecue baked beans. Super good. Not as good as the cheese ruffle ones. Um, six out of 10. Alright. And last but not least, uh, string cheese. Ja, pretty good. It's just cream cheese. Seven out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
