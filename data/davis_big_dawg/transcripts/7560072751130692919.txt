My name is Davis, and today we're trying chipotle. Um, in my bowl I got rice, uh, corn salsa, um, queso cheese, pita de Gallo, sour cream and lettuce. And then I also got some guacamole. We'll, uh, we'll try with and without the guacamole. Alright, so, uh, first without. Always good. Um, I love Chipotle. Uh, this is my first time having the carne asada. Uh, here, let me get a good bite of it. Um, I love carne asada. Um, the Chipotle kind. Very good. Um, I definitely like it a lot. Um, so without the guacamole, eight out of 10. Um, I mean, I love Chipotle, so. Alright, let's uh, let's try with the guacamole. So good. Um, I mean with the guacamole. 9 out of 10. Now we got the, the Fresca Berry Aqua, I think.
