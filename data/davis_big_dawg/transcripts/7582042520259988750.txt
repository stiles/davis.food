My name is Davis, and this is day 32 of reviewing school food. All right, today we got Mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, and some tater tots. Mac and cheese. It's not really cheesy. It's. It's fake cheese. It's pretty good. It's like. It's not that great. I was gonna say pretty good, but it's not really. I'll give that five out of 10. It's really bland. Alright, now we got a chicken nuggets. Ketchup. Oh, god. Chicken nuggets are not that bad. I'll probably give those 6.5 out of 10. The crust could be crunchier, but overall it's not that bad. Alright. Tater tot. Not good. Super undercooked, and they have quite a weird taste. I'll give those three out of 10. Or now we got, um, I think pear and. I don't know. Pear and peaches. Alright, hold up. It's pretty good. Very nice. Peaches are pretty good. I'll give that eight out of 10. Well, thank you, and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
