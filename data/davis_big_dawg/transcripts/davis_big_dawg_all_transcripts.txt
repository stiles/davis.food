My name is Davis, and this is day 30 of reviewing school food. Um, today we got the burger, but I put it on a biscuit. Um, there's lettuce, tomato, and ketchup. Almost see how it is. Okay. A lot better with the biscuit. Um, I'll probably give that 6.5 out of 10. It's kind of dry, but it's still pretty good. Um, I think the tomatoes and the lettuce really add a lot. Um, but also, I was wondering, comment some, um, ideas you guys want for, like, some, uh, content? I mean, I feel like the school lunch is kind of getting boring, but, um, yeah, now we gotta.

My name is Davis, and this is day 20 of reviewing school food. Alright, today we got, um, chicken Alfredo. Hmm. Pretty good. Um, the chicken has really nice seasoning, which I'm very surprised about. And the cheese sauce is also really good. I'll give it 8.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a breadstick. Pretty good. Nice and garlicky. I'll give it seven out of 10. Alright, let's put the Alfredo on top of the breadstick. Eight out of 10. I guess it kind of, like, matched the flavor of the cheese and stuff. Eight out of 10. And now we got carrots with some ranch. Pretty good. Um, 7 out of 10. Cherry, uh, Cherry Pepsi. Pretty good. Um, it's definitely not like my favorite zero sugar soda. There's also some more zero sugar sodas, um, up there, and you have to pay extra, but it's fine. Um, I'll make sure to start reviewing those, too. Um, zero sugar, uh, Cherry Pepsi. 7.5 out of 10.

My name is Davis, and this is part two of reviewing, um, international snacks. I do have a little bit more for one more video if you guys want to see it, but, um, let's start off with this strawberry Oreo cake. If you've ever had a cake stir, I think this is what it is. Alright, this is what it looks like. Looks pretty cool. Oh, god, yeah. It's like a cake stir. It's pretty good. Um, nice strawberry flavor. The cake is kind of. Is really crumbly, though. It's pretty good, though. I'll give this 6.5 out of 10. It's not like my favorite thing, but it's definitely not bad. And now we got a Kitkats. Let's see if these are different from, um, the ones here. Okay, these might be dark chocolate. Pretty good. Has a slightly different taste. I don't really know how to describe it. It's pretty good, though. I'll give those 7 out of 10. Alright, now we got this Asian one. Alright, this is what it looks like. Looks pretty good. No filling inside. Okay. It's just a regular bun. It's kind of dry. It's not terrible, though. Kind of basic. I'll give this five out of 10. Well, thank you, guys. Um, let me know if you want to see another part, and I'll see you tomorrow.

It's Davis. Today I'm reviewing Los Portales supermarket. Um, I'm here with my Davy underwater. What's up, guys? First try the beef barbacoa. Oh, god. It's pretty tough, but nice seasoning. Really good flavor. I'll probably give that like a 6.5 out of 10. It's pretty nice. Give it an an 8. Good flavor to me, yes, but like you said, it is a little tough. Let's try out the rice. Okay. It's pretty good. It's kind of bland. I think it, um, needs some more flavor or something. It's not terrible, but not great. I'll probably give that a 5 out of 10. It was a. This batch is a little, like, hard. I'd give it a 6.5 here. Ever had tamales? About to try them for the first time. I think these are pork. Not terrible. First time ever trying tamales. It's pretty good. I really like the meat inside. The outer is kind of interesting. Um, 6.5 out of 10. 7 out of 10. Probably mine. Flavorful, spicy. I give that one a 9. For our drink we got. It's a Colombian soda. It's called, like, Colombiana. Okay. It tastes like bubblegum. Cheers. Cheers. Wow, that's really good. Not overpowering bubble gum flavor, but you definitely taste it a little bit. It's pretty good. It's not overly sweet, but, like, sweet enough. I'll probably give that like a 8.5 out of 10. For a soda that's really good. Yeah, I'd rate it the same. Well, to finish, It off. We're trying some, um, classic Mexican Coke. Let's see how it is. Okay. That's really good. I feel like it kind of emphasizes, like, the syrupy taste a little bit more than, like, regular American Coke. It's pretty good. It's a little bit sweeter. I'll probably give that nine out of 10. That's. That's pretty good. Well, thank you, guys, and I'll see you tomorrow. Kisses.

My name is Davis, and this is day 34 of reviewing school food. Today we got another walkie taco. Um, this is like probably one of my favorite things. I have sour cream, uh, hot sauce, lettuce and tomato, and then Doritos. Alright, really good. Nice and saucy. Um, there's also cheese in there too. Nice and cheesy. Also something gives a nice song kick. I'll probably give this probably like an 8.59 out of 10. Super good. Alright, now for the drink. We got, um, just regular, uh, zero Sugar Lemonade. I promise you, I do not drink. This is my cameraman. But I'm gonna see how it is. Pretty good. I feel like this zero sugar kind of makes it, um, taste pretty weird. That's like kind of a weird aftertaste. It's not terrible though. I'll probably give that 6.5 out of 10. Not terrible, not great. Um, but thank you guys. So I haven't really been posting school lunch. Um, it's been Christmas break and then also they just keep repeating the same lunches. But I mean, I thank you guys and I'll see you tomorrow.
