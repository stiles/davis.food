My name is Davis, and this is day 34 of reviewing school food. Today we got another walkie taco. Um, this is like probably one of my favorite things. I have sour cream, uh, hot sauce, lettuce and tomato, and then Doritos. Alright, really good. Nice and saucy. Um, there's also cheese in there too. Nice and cheesy. Also something gives a nice song kick. I'll probably give this probably like an 8.59 out of 10. Super good. Alright, now for the drink. We got, um, just regular, uh, zero Sugar Lemonade. I promise you, I do not drink. This is my cameraman. But I'm gonna see how it is. Pretty good. I feel like this zero sugar kind of makes it, um, taste pretty weird. That's like kind of a weird aftertaste. It's not terrible though. I'll probably give that 6.5 out of 10. Not terrible, not great. Um, but thank you guys. So I haven't really been posting school lunch. Um, it's been Christmas break and then also they just keep repeating the same lunches. But I mean, I thank you guys and I'll see you tomorrow.
