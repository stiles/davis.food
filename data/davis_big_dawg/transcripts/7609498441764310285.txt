My name is davis, and today i'm reviewing PB jams. Protein, PB and J. So let's see how it is. My mom got this from, um, walmart. But you can get it from target too, I believe. So here we go. Pretty good. The whole thing about this is like the peanut butter has like protein in it. Can't really taste it though, honestly. Really good. Um, i'll give that like a eight out of ten. Honestly, not bad. Alright, now we got some like, snack mix first. Overall, pretty good lunch, um, at school. Well, thank you guys, and i'll see you tomorrow.
