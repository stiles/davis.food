My name is Davis, and today we're reviewing school food. Um, I think this is like day 9 or something. (Day 9) Um, here. Let's start off with a corn today. Pretty good. Nice and buttery. Um, for corn, there's better, but like corn and messed up corn. Seven out of 10. Um, now we got a chicken tender. It looks kind of weird, but let's see how it is. Now. Waiting for me is crazy. No crunch drink is not that good. Three out of 10. Alright, now we got, um, pizza slice. I'll try without and with ranch. It's. It's really not that good of a pizza. There's better pizzas. Like the Mexican one. I'll get a 4 out of 10 without ranch and 4 out of 10 with ranch. Not that great. Now we got bears. Really good. I like berries. Um, probably more than peaches and stuff. I'll give it a 7 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
