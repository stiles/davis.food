My name is Davis, and this is day 22 of reviewing school food. Today we got a chicken fajita burrito. I put a Texas Pete and, um, sour cream. So let's see how it is. Pretty good. There's cheese in there, too. But look at how bad this thing rolled up. I'll give it seven out of 10. The chicken is really nice. It's nice and seasoned. Um, my burrito wrapping skills was actually pretty good today. So seven out of 10. Alright, now we got some cucumbers. Pretty good. I mean, it's just cucumbers. Um, there's no dressing on or anything. I mean, six out of 10. Well, see you guys tomorrow.
