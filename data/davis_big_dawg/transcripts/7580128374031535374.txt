My name is Davis, and this is day 31 of reviewing school food. Alright, today we got a spaghetti, but it refused. Oh, why are you. It's pretty good. Um, got a food. It's pretty good though. The pasta is good. Meat sauce is good. Um, I'll probably give that 6.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a breadstick. Let's dip it in here. Okay. Could be cooked longer. Not the best today. I'll give this four out of ten. Alright, now we got a peaches. Pretty good. Um, pretty good. I feel like they're not. That they're a little old. I'll probably give those six out of ten. Okay. Pretty good. Nice barbecue flavor. Nice and salty. I'll give those 7 out of 10. Well, thank you guys. Sorry, I haven't really been reviewing school lunch. Um, make sure you check out my Instagram and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
