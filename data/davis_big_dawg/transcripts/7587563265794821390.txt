My name is Davis. I'm at which witch today. Um, I got a Philly cheese steak. Let's just see how it is. I put lettuce, tomato, and ranch on there. Okay. Really salty. Pretty good, though. Um, as for extra meat, it's not too much. I would say it's pretty good, though. I'll probably give that probably seven out of 10. Now we got, um, Harvest Cheddar, Sun Chips. Oh, god. Pretty good. Nice. And cheddar. I'll probably give those eight out of 10. Overall. Pretty good. Well, thank you, guys, and I'll see you tomorrow.
