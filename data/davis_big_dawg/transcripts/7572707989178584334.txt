My name is Davis. Um, today we're at alpaca. I got the. I don't know the name of it, but it's steak, um, on some fries and then some rice. There's onions and some tomatoes. Um, yeah, let's. Let's try it out. I'll try the rest of the steak. ها يا كلب the rice is really really nice um the seasoning is really good um the steak is very very tender it's not like. Chewy that is really good. Um, I'll probably, give, that 9.5 out of 10 that is really good. And then here, I'll try it with, like, all the other stuff. Let me try this. Okay. The fries. Okay. The fries are really just, like. It's not crunchy at all. It's not. It's not what I want with the fry. The fries. And I'll probably give that 6.5 out of 10, but. What? The rice in the steak is really good. Um, yeah, very good.
