My name is Davis. This is day 5 of reviewing school lunch. Alright, we got um, I think it's sesame seed chicken or orange chicken. Let's see how it is. It's nice and sweet. Um, this will be a little bit warmer, but it's fine. Long line. Um, I give that a seven out of 10. Alright, now we got rice. I think it's fried rice, but we'll see how it is. It's okay. Um, it's. Holy cow. It's kind of grainy, I would say like, you know how you want your recipe fluffy. It's not that. It's kind of bland, but it's okay. Um, six out of 10. No, 5.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got um, curly fries and a potato wedges. So we'll see how they are. Alright, first we got curly fries. I really like the curly fries. 7 out of 10 too. Alright. And then potato wedge. Pretty good. I think I prefer the curly fries, but potato wedges, 6.5 out of 10. Now we got um, melon. Always really good. Um, you can tell it's pretty fresh. It's not like old or anything. It's pretty, pretty new. It's really good. Um, not dried out, has juice. And then now we got a pineapple. Just your basic pineapple. It's a little like, little too hard. I feel like. I don't know. Um, I'll give it like a six out of 10. Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
