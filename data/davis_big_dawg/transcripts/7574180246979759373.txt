Davis, this is day 29 ... of reviewing school food. Um, today we got the Thanksgiving lunch. Been looking forward to this. Kind of excited. First we got a. The Turkey. It looks like it's in a gravy. See how it is? Pretty good. Um, it's like shredded Turkey and gravy. It's pretty good. Probably need some salt and pepper though. I'll probably give that eight out of 10. It's definitely, definitely better than most. Alright, now we got, um, the stuffing. Okay. It's kind of mushy. It's alright though. I'll probably give that like a six out of 10. Um. Yeah. Alright, now we got our mashed potatoes. Pretty good. Um, you can tell us, like, the instant mashed potatoes. It's pretty good though. I'll probably give it a 7 out of 10. I think mixing the Turkey with that will be very good. Um, now we got some green beans. Okay. Um. Not the biggest green bean green bean guy. I'm more like a broccoli and stuff like that. It's kind of mushy. Um, I'll probably give those a 5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a apple cobbler. Pretty excited about this. Nice and hot. Definitely some seasoning. That's really good. I'll probably give that 8.5 out of 10. Well, thank you guys. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
