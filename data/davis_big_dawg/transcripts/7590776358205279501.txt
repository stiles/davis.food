My name is Davis. Today I'm reviewing these chicken soup dumplings. I'm pretty excited to try this. I've had soup dumplings a couple times, but it's been a while. Almost see how they are. Oh, my god. I think we got these from Aldi. Um, and I have, like, a soy sauce flavor. They're pretty good. Um, I wish there's more soup in them. I'll probably give those seven out of 10. Those are. Those are actually pretty good. I would definitely eat these again. Um, yeah. Well, thank you, guys, and I'll see you tomorrow.
