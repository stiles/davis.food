My name is Davis, and this is day 30 of reviewing school food. Um, today we got the burger, but I put it on a biscuit. Um, there's lettuce, tomato, and ketchup. Almost see how it is. Okay. A lot better with the biscuit. Um, I'll probably give that 6.5 out of 10. It's kind of dry, but it's still pretty good. Um, I think the tomatoes and the lettuce really add a lot. Um, but also, I was wondering, comment some, um, ideas you guys want for, like, some, uh, content? I mean, I feel like the school lunch is kind of getting boring, but, um, yeah, now we gotta. Tropical Lime Brawha Blast. Uh, zero sugar. Pretty good. What? One of my favorite sodas. I'll probably give this 8 out of 10. Well, thank you. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
