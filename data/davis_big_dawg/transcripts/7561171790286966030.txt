My name is Davis, and this is Day 14 of reviewing school food. I said Day 13 twice, so I guess. No, it's Day 15. I'm sorry. Alright, we got a walking taco today. I have Doritos meat, cheese, lettuce, and then some Tupito's hot sauce. Give it a try. No sour cream today, which is unfortunate. Oh, and we have rice in here. Um, one of my favorite meals. Maybe. Maybe my number one favorite meal. I don't know. It's missing the sour cream and stuff. As far as there's, uh, last weeks or two weeks ago, um, eight out of 10, we got, um, peaches, I think. Um, so candy. Peaches is very good. Seven out of 10. We got a Rice Krispie treat. I mean, Rice Krispie and marshmallow. It's so good. And these remind me of my childhood. My grandma used to always have these. Um, nine out of 10. Now we got apple juice. I mean, it's just apple juice. It's. It's pretty good. Um, seven out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
