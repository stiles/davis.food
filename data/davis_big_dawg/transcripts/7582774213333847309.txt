My name is Davis and this is day 33 of reviewing school food. Alright, today we got a meat sauce and some, um, noodles. Pretty good? I don't know, some like, the noodles are like really soft. Really, really soft and really mushy. It's really not that bad though. I'll give that 6.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a. Some salad with ranch. The lettuce is really good today. Um, pretty good actually. I'll give that eight out of 10. Alright, now we got porn. Nice and buttery. Nice and sweet. Could use some more salt and pepper. I'll probably give that 5 5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a breadstick. Dip it in the spaghetti. Alright. It's really hard today. Nice and garlicky though. Pretty good overall. I'll give this six out of 10 flat. All right, now we got, um, apple and me, uh, apple juice. See how it is? Pretty good. Um, 100% juice, no sugar added. Pretty good. I'll probably give this 7.5 out of 10. Well, thank you guys and I'll see you tomorrow.
