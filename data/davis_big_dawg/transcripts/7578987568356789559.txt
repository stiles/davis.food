My name is Davis, and this is day 31 of reviewing school food. Um, today we got a grilled cheese and tomato soup. See how it is, then I stomp. Alright, here we go. Alright. I wish the cheese was melted more. It's pretty good, though. Um, the tomato soup is really good. It's nice and sweet. It's nice and warm. This combo, one of my favorite. I'm give that 9.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got a French fries. I'm gonna dip these in the tomato soup, too. Okay. Not that great. Um, kind of bland and really potatoey. I'll give those six out of 10. Well, thank you, guys. Uh, that was today's lunch review, and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
