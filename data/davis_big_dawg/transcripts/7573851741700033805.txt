My name is Davis, and this is day 28 of reviewing school food. New lunch today. Pretty happy about that. Uh, we got a barbecue sandwich. No barbecue sauce. Kind of unfortunate, but very good. It's nice and moist. It's not dry. What I'm happy about. I'll give that, um, 7.5 out of 10. If it had barbecue sauce, it would probably be like a 9. Pretty good. Right now we got a curly fries and some ketchup. Oh, well, not that great today. It's kind of soggy. Kinda full 5 out of 10. And now we got a cheesy broccoli. Pretty good. Not that cheesy though. I'll give that 5.5 out of 10. Alright, now we got, um, apple juice. Pretty good. I love apple juice. I'll give that 8 out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
