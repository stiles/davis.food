My name is Davis, and today, I think this is day 13 of reviewing school food. Alright, first we got um, a burger. I put lettuce and ketchup on there. Um, it's not terrible. It's not really great though. Um, the burger patties like almost, like not real, I guess 6 out of ten. Alright, now we got um, curly fries. They're actually warm today, which is good. Alright. Ketchup, pretty good. Um, no crunch, but I do like the flavor a lot. Um, I'm gonna give them a 5 out of 10. Alright, uh, now we got white milk. Um, I'm basically gonna just try all the melts. Like, I've done chocolate, strawberry, now I'm doing white, and then I'm probably never gonna review them again. Um, but here we go. I mean, I love milk. It's probably like top three drinks for me. Um, nine out of 10. I, I love milk a lot. So, um, I think it goes chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. Alright, now we got um, a cookie to try. I try without and with the milk. Um, I'll give the cookie a 5.5 out of 10 without the milk and a 6 out of 10 with the milk. Now we got, um, oranges. I think it's an orange or, or it's like grapefruit. Grapefruit or something. I think it's grapefruit. I'll give it seven out of 10. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
